<h2 id="overview">Research Overview</h2>
In today's information and computational society, complex systems such as social media, e-commerce platform, digital library, cyber-physical system, or chemical synthesis, are often associated with heterogeneous (multi-modal) data, including structural relation/graph/network, unstructured attribute/text/image, temporal context, and so on. The heterogeneous data provide opportunities for researchers and practitioners to understand complex systems more comprehensively but also pose challenges to discover knowledge from them. The challenges come from not only the complexity and heterogeneity of the data for investigation but also the requirement of the target problem to be solved. The goal of our research is to harness the power of heterogeneous data, turn them into useful knowledge, develop artificial intelligence solutions based on the extracted knowledge for a diverse set of real-world applications. The current active research topics of our lab include:
<li> Data Mining, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artifical Intelligence
<li> Graph/Network Mining, Graph Embedding/Neural Network
<li> Knowledge Bases Reasoning, Text Mining, Natural Language Processing
<li> Recommender Systems, User Behavior Modeling
<li> Machine Learning for Science (e.g., Chemical Synthesis)
<li> Time Series and Spatial-temporal Data Analysis

    <div>Brandeis is a private research university in the Boston area - one of the most important metropolitan regions of economy, culture, and education in USA. It was founded in 1948 as a non-sectarian, coeducational institution sponsored by the Jewish community. In 2018, it had a total enrollment of 5,800 students on its suburban campus spanning 235 acres (95 hectares). The institution offers more than 43 majors and 46 minors, and two-thirds of undergraduate classes have 20 students or fewer. Alumni and affiliates of the university include several recipients of Nobel Prize, Fields Medalist, as well as foreign heads of state, congressmen, governors, diplomats. 
    According to the U.S. News 2020 best national universities ranking, Brandeis ranks 40 in overall ranking and 91 in computer science ranking. </div>
